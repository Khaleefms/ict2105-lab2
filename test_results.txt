Test 1:
OnCreate() calls: 1
OnStart() calls: 1
onResume() calls: 1
onRestart() calls: 0

Upon starting the ActivityOne, the following message could be seen:
Entered the onCreate() method
Entered the onStart() method
Entered the onResume() method
As the app is opened at the first time, the onCreate() is called followed by onStart() and onResume(). Normally, onStart() and onResume() goes hand in hand.

Test2:
OnCreate() calls: 1
OnStart() calls: 2
onResume() calls: 2
onRestart() calls: 1
Once screen is turn off, the following message could be seen:
Entered the onPause() method
Entered the onStop() method
Once screen is turned off, onPause() and onStop() is called. This is because the activity state goes into a "sleep" mode.

Once screen is turned on, the following message could be seen:
Entered the onRestart() method
Entered the onStart() method
Entered the onResume() method
Once the screen is turned on, onRestart() is called to restart the activity, and then onStart(), onResume().
The screen goes off to save resources. As the documentation states, it is recommended that activities to be able to be stopped and restarted at any time.

Test3:
OnCreate() calls: 2
OnStart() calls: 2
onResume() calls: 2
onRestart() calls: 0

Switching to landscape mode, the following message could be seen:
Entered the onPause() method
Entered the onStop() method
Entered the onDestroy() method
Entered the onCreate() method
Entered the onStart() method
Entered the onResume() method
-----------------------------------
OnCreate() calls: 3
OnStart() calls: 3
onResume() calls: 3
onRestart() calls: 0

Switching to portrait mode, the following message could be seen:
Entered the onPause() method
Entered the onStop() method
Entered the onDestroy() method
Entered the onCreate() method
Entered the onStart() method
Entered the onResume() method

The restart behavior is designed to help your application adapt to new configurations by 
automatically reloading your application with alternative resources that match the new device configuration.
To properly handle a restart, it is important that your activity restores its previous state 
through the normal Activity lifecycle, in which Android calls onSaveInstanceState() before it destroys your 
activity so that you can save data about the application state. You can then restore the state during onCreate() or onRestoreInstanceState().

Test4:
OnCreate() calls: 1
OnStart() calls: 1
onResume() calls: 1
onRestart() calls: 0

Upon starting ActivityTwo, the following message could be seen:
Entered the onPause() method
Entered the onCreate() method
Entered the onStart() method
Entered the onResume() method
Entered the onStop() method

Similar to test 1, however ActivityOne, is onPause() and onStop(), while ActivityTwo, onCreate(), onStart(), onResume().

Test5:
OnCreate() calls: 2
OnStart() calls: 2
onResume() calls: 2
onRestart() calls: 0

Switching to landscape mode, the following message could be seen:
Entered the onPause() method
Entered the onStop() method
Entered the onDestroy() method
Entered the onCreate() method
Entered the onStart() method
Entered the onResume() method
-----------------------------------
OnCreate() calls: 3
OnStart() calls: 3
onResume() calls: 3
onRestart() calls: 0

Switching to portrait mode, the following message could be seen:
Entered the onPause() method
Entered the onStop() method
Entered the onDestroy() method
Entered the onCreate() method
Entered the onStart() method
Entered the onResume() method

Explaination similar to test 3.

Test6:
OnCreate() calls: 1
OnStart() calls: 1
onResume() calls: 1
onRestart() calls: 0

Upon starting ActivityTwo, the following message could be seen:
Entered the onPause() method
Entered the onCreate() method
Entered the onStart() method
Entered the onResume() method
Entered the onStop() method
-----------------------------------
OnCreate() calls: 1
OnStart() calls: 2
onResume() calls: 2
onRestart() calls: 1

Upon closing ActivityTwo, the following message could be seen:
Entered the onPause() method
Entered the onRestart() method
Entered the onStart() method
Entered the onResume() method
Entered the onStop() method
Entered the onDestroy() method

Once you press the back key the activity's onDestroy() method will be called and the activity will be flushed out of the memory. 
You will then be required to restart the activity by calling the startActivity() method which will in turn call its onCreate() Method.

Test7:
OnCreate() calls: 1
OnStart() calls: 1
onResume() calls: 1
onRestart() calls: 0

Upon starting ActivityTwo, the following message could be seen:
Entered the onPause() method
Entered the onCreate() method
Entered the onStart() method
Entered the onResume() method
Entered the onStop() method
-----------------------------------
OnCreate() calls: 1
OnStart() calls: 2
onResume() calls: 2
onRestart() calls: 1

Upon closing ActivityTwo, the following message could be seen:
Entered the onPause() method
Entered the onRestart() method
Entered the onStart() method
Entered the onResume() method
Entered the onStop() method
Entered the onDestroy() method
-----------------------------------
OnCreate() calls: 1
OnStart() calls: 1
onResume() calls: 1
onRestart() calls: 0

Upon starting ActivityTwo, the following message could be seen:
Entered the onPause() method
Entered the onCreate() method
Entered the onStart() method
Entered the onResume() method
Entered the onStop() method

Explainations similar to test 4 and test 6.

Point to take note:
- Switching to different view(portrait to landscape or vice versa), is similar to closing, killing the app and then opening the app again.
- If navigating to a different activity, onPause(), onCreate(), onStart(), onResume() and onStop() will be called.
- Once an app is destroyed by calling onDestroy(), onCreate() will normally be called when an app is starting.
