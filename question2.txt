When back button was pressed in ActivityOne, observed the following lifecycle:
onPause()
onStop()
onDestroy()

When home button was pressed in ActivityOne, observed the following lifecycle:
onPause()
onStop()

Upon opening ActivityLab again, after home button is pressed, observed the following lifecycle:
onRestart()
onStart()
onResume()

There is a stack of activities, but not applications. Therefore, when pressing the home button the activity in the current application just "pauses"
as if it was a stand-by/sleeping mode, therefore multiple applications can be in this state as long as the system does not require memory and killing tasks. 
Whenever you open the activity from the recent tasks, its just telling the application to wake up.
